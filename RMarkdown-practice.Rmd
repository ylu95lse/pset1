# RMarkdown practice

This is an example of a simple RMarkdown file that can be edited and fixed.

There is a chunk with R code below that contains an intentional mistake. 

Fix it and compile the RMarkdown file. Then, stage the changes and commit to your repository.


```{r}
a <- runif(n=99)
b <- runif(n=100)
plot(x, y)
```
